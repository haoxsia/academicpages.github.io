## Abstract

Coupled electromechanical resonators that can be independently driven/detected and easily integrated with external 
circuits are essential for exploring mechanical modes based signal processing. Here, we present a room temperature 
phonon-cavity electromechanical system, consisting of two distinct resonators: a silicon nitride electromechanical 
drum capacitively coupled to an aluminum one. We demonstrate electromechanically induced transparency and amplification
in a two-tone driving scheme and observe the phonon-cavity force affecting the mechanical damping rates of both movable
objects. We also develop an analytical model based on linearly coupled motion equations, which captures the optomechanical 
features in the classical limit and enables to fit quantitatively our measurements. Our results open up new possibilities 
in the study of phonon-cavity based signal processing in the classical and potentially in the future in the quantum regimes.
