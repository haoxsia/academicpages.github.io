## Abstract

Silicon nitride (SiN) mechanical resonators with high quality mechanical properties
are attractive for fundamental research and applications. However, it is challenging to
maintain these mechanical properties while achieving strong coupling to an electrical
circuit for efficient on-chip integration. Here, we present a SiN drum resonator covered
with an aluminum thin film, enabling large capacitive coupling to a suspended top-gate.
Implementing the full electrical measurement scheme, we demonstrate a high quality
factor ∼ 1E4(comparable to that of bare drums at room temperature) and present our
ability to detect ∼ 10 mechanical modes at low temperature. The drum resonator is
also coupled to a microwave cavity, so that we can perform optomechanical sideband
pumping with a fairly good coupling strength G and demonstrate mechanical parametric
amplification. This SiN drum resonator design provides efficient electrical integration
and exhibits promising features for exploring mode coupling and signal processing.
