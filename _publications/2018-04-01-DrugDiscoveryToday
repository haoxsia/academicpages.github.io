## Abstract
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can selectively target and downregulate disease-causing genes, holding
great promise in treating human diseases, especially malignant cancers. However, how to efficiently
deliver siRNAs into target cell cytosol is a problem that has hindered their clinical application. Here, we
review the recent strategies for siRNA delivery on the basis of smart nanocarriers by using stimuliresponsive
materials. We highlight the rationales of how to design smart nanocarriers responsive to
physiological and external stimuli to improve the delivery efficiency, targeting precision and gene
silencing efficacy. Finally, we provide an outlook on the fundamental limitation for clinical translation
of siRNA-based nanomedicine that should be overcome by the combination of chemistry, biology,
material and medical science.
