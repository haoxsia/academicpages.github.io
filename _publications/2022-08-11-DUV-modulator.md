## Abstract

Birefringence is a fundamental optical property that can induce phase retardation of polarized light. 
Tuning the birefringence of liquid crystals is a core technology for light manipulation in current 
applications in the visible and infrared spectral regions. Due to the strong absorption or instability 
of conventional liquid crystals in deep-ultraviolet light, tunable birefringence remains elusive in this
region, notwithstanding its significance in diverse applications. Here we show a stable and birefringence-tunable 
deep-ultraviolet modulator based on two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride. It has an extremely large optical 
anisotropy factor of 6.5 × 10^−12 C^2 J^−1 m^−1 that gives rise to a specific magneto-optical Cotton–Mouton 
coefficient of 8.0 × 10^6 T^−2 m^−1, which is about five orders of magnitude higher than other potential 
deep-ultraviolet-transparent media. The large coefficient, high stability (retention rate of 99.7% after 
270 cycles) and wide bandgap of boron nitride collectively enable the fabrication of stable deep-ultraviolet 
modulators with magnetically tunable birefringence.
