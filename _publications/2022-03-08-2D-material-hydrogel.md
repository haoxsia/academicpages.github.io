## Abstract

Transparent hydrogels are key materials for many applications, such as contact lens,
imperceptible soft robotics and invisible wearable devices. Introducing large and engineerable
optical anisotropy offers great prospect for endowing them with extra birefringence-based
functions and exploiting their applications in see-through flexible polarization optics. 
However, existing transparent hydrogels suffer from limitation of low and/or non-fine engineerable
birefringence. Here, we invent a transparent magneto-birefringence hydrogel with large
and finely engineerable optical anisotropy. The large optical anisotropy factor of the
embedded magnetic two-dimensional material gives rise to the large magneto-birefringence
of the hydrogel in the transparent condition of ultra-low concentration, which is several
orders of magnitude larger than usual transparent magnetic hydrogels. High transparency,
large and tunable optical anisotropy cooperatively permit the magnetic patterning of 
interference colours in the hydrogel. The hydrogel also shows mechanochromic and thermochromic 
property. Our finding provides an entry point for applying hydrogel in optical
anisotropy and colour centred fields, with several proof-of-concept applications been
demonstrated.
