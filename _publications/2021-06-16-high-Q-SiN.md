## Abstract

Silicon nitride (SiN) mechanical resonators with high quality mechanical properties are attractive for fundamental 
research and applications. However, it is challenging to maintain these mechanical properties while achieving strong 
coupling to an electrical circuit for efficient on-chip integration. Here, we present a SiN drum resonator covered 
with an aluminum thin film, enabling large capacitive coupling to a suspended top-gate. Implementing the full electrical
measurement scheme, we demonstrate a high quality factor ∼10^4 (comparable to that of bare drums at room temperature)
and present our ability to detect ∼10 mechanical modes at low temperature. The drum resonator is also coupled to 
a microwave cavity, so that we can perform optomechanical sideband pumping with a fairly good coupling strength G and
demonstrate mechanical parametric amplification. This SiN drum resonator design provides efficient electrical integration 
and exhibits promising features for exploring mode coupling and signal processing.
