## Short intro

> Mechanical resonator plays a promising role for investigating the interaction between light and mechanical motion, the interaction of which is at the heart of optomechanics. Having high-Q factor helps it to enhance measurement sensitivity in either classical or quantum regime. As dissipation dilution engineering emerges, largely enhancing Q factor is possible due to the effective control of tensile stress and geometric structures of materials, such as silicon nitride. Along this way, we are interested in finding a dissipation solution to enhance Q factor. Interestingly, we found some spider webs done well and explored shaking the webs to draw spider's attention. Mimicking a prey trapping with frequency of about 5.5 Hz, a spider catches "it", indicating spiders feeling some mechancial vibritions on the web instead of using eyes. As far as I observed, why spider's web is usually clamped on the object with 8 draglines? I suppose that they evolved since long time ago in order to capture preys effectively. To do so, dissipation engineering is naturally used for achieving high Q, thereby enhancing their feeling sensitivity on the web. By looking into this phenomenon, **ongoing...**
