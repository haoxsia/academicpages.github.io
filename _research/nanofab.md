In this set of projects, I use advanced quanitative methods to tackle the problem of more accurately measuring concepts of interest in international relations. One uses Bayesian latent variable models to directly assess the strength of peace agreements in civil conflict rather than having to use agreement duration as a proxy for strength. Another harnesses advances in big data and develops new measures of economic interdependence and methods for detecting disruptions of regular economic exchange between states from a product-level trade dataset with over two billion observations.

Figs.(a-g) show the fabrication process of silicon nitride drum mechanical resonators.
We define the diameter of the drum by using electron beam (EB) resist CSAR62 to pattern circularly symmetric
holes. The drum is released from the Si substrate by reactive ion etching (RIE) of the SiN
layer (SF6 : Ar = 10 sccm : 10 sccm, for 6.5 min) through these opened holes, followed by a
selective XeF2 silicon etching. These holes occupy about 40 % ~ 45 % of the SiN drum area.
Its suspended top-gate is fabricated by using EB resist PMMA as a top-gate support through
soft-bake at the temperature of 140 centidegree and reflowed at 180 centidegree. Then, we deposit the second
layer EB resist MMA (methyl methacrylate) on the top of the support resist and pattern the
gate structure. For the metal depositions, we first perform Ar ion etching process to clean
the sample and then use with electron beam evaporation to deposition the thin films. All
bonding pads on the chip are designed to be 50 Ohm impedance for microwave signals.
