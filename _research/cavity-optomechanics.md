Nano-/micro-electromechanical systems (NEMS/MEMS) allow mechanical degrees of freedom (e.g., displacement) to couple with electrical signals. They are promising devices for fundamental research, such as sensing tiny mass [^1], force [^2] and motion [^3]. Recent examples have implemented nonlinearity and mechanical transduction design to realize logic gates [^4] and RF amplifiers [^5]. In very recent years, two different individual mechanical resonators in capacitively coupled schemes have been built for observing their entanglement [^6]. The multimode optomechanical sensing in mechanical resonators has also been established for sensing a single nanoparticle [^7]. Because nanoelectromechanics featuring mechanical displacement exhibits an analog behaviour to optomechanical systems, phonon-cavity electromechanics consisting of "mechanical objects" coupling with "microwave cavity" presents phenomena of phonon interferences. With these reasons, capacitively coupled different mechanical resonators are still promising.

## Schematic of capacitively coupled two distinct mechanical resonators

As **Fig.(a)** shows, two mechanical resonators embedded in the electrical integrated circuits can be independently driven by RF1 and RF2 signals. They can also be independently detected with a signal from microwave source. **Fig.(b)** shows a cross sectional view of mechanical resonators consisting of a SiN drum membrane coupled to a suspended Al drum membrane. In this work, we did nanofabrication of SiN drum membrane with 80 nm thickness and 36 um diameter, and the Al drum membrane with 550 nm thickness and 40 um diameter (see [nanofab](https://haoxsia.github.io/research/nanofab/)). **Fig.(c)** demonstrates linear resonance responses of the Al drum and SiN drum resonators, showing the Al drum with a low frequency of 2.95 MHz and the SiN drum with a high frequency of 11.792 MHz. We therefore investigate such two mechanical resonators by using the mechanical mode (SiN drum) with higher resonance frequency $Ω_{1}$ as phonon cavity and pumping this cavity with a signal frequency difference $∼Ω_{1} ± Ω_{2}$, also called red/blue sidebands, where $Ω_{2}$ is a low resonance frequency from the other mode (Al drum).

## Strategy of spectrum operation at red/blue sideband pumping

When probing the phonon cavity (SiN drum), we present our spectrum operation at red/blue sidebands. In this two-tone scheme, the electromechanical interactions between two capacitively coupled mechanical resonators can be interpreted into two processes in order to describe the phonons transfer. **Fig.(a)** shows that the probe and pump tones create mechanical phonons acting on the unprobed Al drum, marked by red arrow process. At the same moment, these created mechanical phonons are fed back to the probed SiN drum resonator, marked by grey process. Therefore, an interference is built between these phonons. This is because of the phonons on the unprobed Al drum (related to the term $n_{p}g_{0}^2χ_{2}$) and the initial probed phonons (related to the term $χ_{1}$), where $n_{p}$ is the phonon number generated by the pumping force, $g_{0}$ is the single phonon coupling strength, $χ_{1}$ and $χ_{2}$ are mechanical susceptibilities of SiN drum and the Al drum resonators. This interference phenomena can either be destructive or constructive depending on the phonon cavity (SiN drum) pumped at red/blue sidebands. **Fig.(b)** shows mechanical response suppressed fully when the phonon cavity pumped at a red sideband, and mechanical response getting a larger amplification when the phonon cavity pumped at a blue sideband.

When probing the Al drum, **Fig.(a)** shows that the probe and pump tones create mechanical phonons acting on the unprobed SiN drum, marked by red arrow process. At the same moment, these created mechanical phonons are fed back to the probed Al drum resonator, marked by grey process. An interference therefore is built between these phonons. Similarly, this is because of the phonons on the unprobed SiN drum (related to the term $n_{p}g_{0}^2χ_{1}$ or $n_{p}g_{0}^2χ_{1}^* $) and the initial probed phonons (related to the term $χ_{2}$). It is worth noting that the phonon cavity damping rate is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the coupled Al drum. As known from a probe signal at the coupled Al drum, the damping rate of the unprobed SiN drum (related to the term $n_{p}g_{0}^2χ_{1}$ or $n_{p}g_{0}^2χ_{1}^* $) determines the frequency bandwidth of transparency or amplification effects. **Fig.(b)** shows Lorentzian mechanical response of the probed Al drum exhibiting a narrow dip inside the transparency bandwidth window due to $γ_{SiN}<γ_{Al}$. This phenomenon is observed for investigating transparency and amplification through engineering mechanical damping rates.

## Electromechanically induced transparency and amplification

We experimentally demonstrate electomechanically induced transparency and amplification. **Fig.(b,e)** shows that when probing the phonon cavity (SiN drum), we measure mechanical responses of the coupled drum resonators as a function of the pump tone detuning $Δ$ and the probe frequency detuning $δ$ at red/blue sideband pumping. These measurements indicate that mechanical damping rate corresponding to the pump tone detuning $Δ$ correlates to the unprobed Al drum. Here, the unprobed Al drum can be as a phonon transfer station. Within the interference bandwidth of the unprobed Al drum resonator, phonons can be generated due to the interaction between probe and pump tone, and can coherently become destructive in **Fig.(b)** and constructive in **Fig.(e)** interferences.

</p>

When still probing the phonon cavity (SiN drum), we measure electromechanical responses of the probed SiN and unprobed Al drums at blue sideband pumping. **Fig.(b)** shows a vivid sketch of two capacitively coupled Al and SiN drums. **Fig.(c)** demonstrates a constructive interference when mechanical response is amplified within the interference window. Simultaneously, **Fig.(e)** indicates phonons generation detected with mechanical response of the unprobed Al drum resonator. This phenomenon manifests the electromechanical capacitive coupling between two drums “dancing” at the same time.

</p>

When probing the Al drum, **Fig.(b)** shows a destructive interference of mechanical response of the probed Al drum. At this red sideband, it is worth to notice that the measurement results in **Fig.(b)** feature splitting within the transparency window due to $γ_{SiN}<γ_{Al}$. This means mechanical damping rate of the unprobed SiN drum (related to the term $n_{p}g_{0}^2χ_{1}$) determines the transparency frequency bandwidth of the Al drum.

In brief, capacitively coupled SiN and Al drum resonators have been demonstrated, including strategies of spectrum operation at red/blue sidebands and electromechanically induced transparency/amplification applications.
