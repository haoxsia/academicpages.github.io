## Preface

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been a promising candidate for microelectronics and optoelectronics applications due to their excellent optical, electrical, and mechanical properties [^1]. However, as-synthesized SWCNTs are mixtures of metallic SWCNTs (m-SWCNTs) and semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs), which hinders their practical uses in high-performance electronics and photovoltaic devices. Fortunately, many post-synthetic sorting methods have been well developed to eliminate such barrier, including density gradient ultracentrifugation [^2], DNA molecule wrapping [^3] or conjugated polymer wrapping [^4]. Here, we choose conjugated polymer wrapping to sort s-SWCNTs because of its high selectivity, high yield and easy implementation.

## UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy of PFT-sorted s-SWCNTs

In this work, we use a copolymer backbone structure of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-thiophene] (PFT) for the selective extraction of s-SWCNTs mixed in the entire body of SWCNTs. After raw SWCNT powers dispersing in PFT based dispersions, mainly followed by tip-ultrasonication, resultant PFT/SWCNT solutions can be obtained and characterized after a certain centrifugation. **Fig.A** shows UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of PFT/s-SWCNT compared to a reference SDS(polymer)/SWCNT, indicating the comparable group has stronger absorption in the metallic $M_{11}$ band but the PFT/s-SWCNT is not. This is because polymer structures are different. To determine the selectivity of extraction for s-SWCNTs, **Fig.B** shows that the pristine SWCNTs include metallic nanotubes with chiralities (12,6) and (8,8), and semiconducting nanotubes with chiralities (7,6) and (7,5). Compared to this, PFT/s-SWCNTs wrapping selectively enriches semiconducting nanotubes with chirality (7,5).

## Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy of PFT-sorted s-SWCNTs

We also implement photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrometry to investigate chirality indices of PFT-sorted-s-SWCNTs. **Fig.A** shows the pristine SWCNTs as a control group, showing all possible chiralities of the SWCNTs. After selectively sorted by PFT, the underlying background and SWCNTs species were greatly reduced in **Fig.B**. But the fluorescence intensity of chirality (9,5)-SWCNTs remained strongest. This is because the PFT selectively extracts the chirality of (9,5), and subsequently the chiralities of (n,m)=(8,6), (7,5) and (10,5).

In brief, the PFT polymer is useful to enrich the chiralities of s-SWCNTs from the mixtures. This provides a facile and simple strategy for microelectronics and photovoltaic applications. For more details see our paper [here](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ntrev-2018-0041/html)
