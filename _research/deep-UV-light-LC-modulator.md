## Preface

Birefringence is a fundamental optical property that can allow some external stimulus, like magnetic or electrical field, to induce phase retardation of polarized light. Tuning the birefringence of liquid crystals (LCs) is a core technology for light manipulation in various applications, such as LC displays [^1], light modulators [^2], holographic imagers [^3], and optical tweezers [^4]. Most of these applications can only be used in the visible and infrared wavelengths, but rather than in as short as deep ultraviolet (DUV) wavelength. This is because the conventional LCs with organic components own the strong absorption or instability in the DUV spectral region. Therefore, the development of LCs without organic components is of great potential in manipulating DUV light.

## Magneto-birefringence effect of 2D hBN suspension

Here, we present the development of a transmissive DUV light modulator using two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-based inorganic LCs. We investigate its fundamental physical properties, such as birefringence and magnetism, giving rise to a giant magneto-optical effect due to its large shape anisotropy with a typical aspect ratio (defined as lateral size divided by thickness) 170 (for more info see main text). **Fig.(a)** shows a schematic of the light path in the magnetic-field-induced optical experiment, and explanation of the light propagation by decomposing polarized light into horizontal and vertical components of electric-field vector. It is worth noticing that when magnetic field turns on, the alignment of hBN LCs is parallel to the magnetic field direction, which induces two electric-field components forming a phase retardation. These two components further propagate through the analyzer, thereby tuning the optical intensity. **Fig.(b)** shows strong magnetic-field-induced optical effects in the real cuvette (length 10 mm, width 10 mm and height 40 mm) filled with hBN LC suspensions, demonstrating light on and off when magnetic field turns on and off, where two crossed polarizers are present by white double arrows. **Fig.(c)** presents strong magnetic-field-induced optical effects of hBN LC suspensions using our photomasks of “TBSI SGC” and panda patterns with a scale bar 5 mm.

## Magnetic-field-induced alignment and magneto-birefringence of 2D hBN inorganic LCs

Magnetic-field-induced alignment of hBN LCs is important in investigating the behavior of the magneto-optical switching, which relates to the determination of light propagation in the hBN LC suspension. **Fig.(a)** shows transmittance intensity varying of polarized laser light through hBN LCs when the polarization direction is parallel or perpendicular to a magnetic field of 0.8 Tesla. To our knowledge, light decomposed as horizontal and vertical components spatially propagates through hBN LC suspension. Here we show the illustration of polarization-direction-dependent optical loss, indicating the fact that light is absorbed or scattered heavily when the polarization direction is parallel to the magnetic field direction. This can speculate that the magnetic-field-induced hBN is parallel to the magnetic field direction. **Fig.(b)** demonstrates the measurement of a fundamental birefringence of hBN LCs, which is well fitted by an analytical model, where $Δχ$ the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility plays a major role in controlling the alignment of hBN LCs. In order for magnetic-field-induced optical effects to analyse the intrinsic mechanism, we further investigate a specific Cotton-Mouton coefficient (defined as Cotton-Mouton coefficient in **Fig.(c)** divided by the volume concentration) of the magneto-optical sensitivity of hBN LCs in the suspension, which is experimentally measured with a giant value of $8.0 \times 10^{6} T^{-2}m^{-1}$. This specific Cotton-Mouton coefficient has been analytically derived in this work with a derivative description $C_{sp-CM}$ = $ΔgΔχ$/(30 $λ$ $n_{s}$ $\varepsilon_{0}$ $k_{B}$ $T$), where it mainly depends on optical $Δg$ and magnetic $Δχ$ anisotropies of hBN LCs and is independent of the volume concentration of hBN LC suspension. (for more details see our paper)

Based on the principal analysis of magnetic-field-induced optical effects of hBN LCs, we therefore investigate the hBN LCs to modulate DUV light as short as 266 nm. Nowadays, a lot of LC-related literatures [^2][^5][^6] have showed their good device performance working either in the visible or the infrared spectral region, even entering the UV-A spectral region, nevertheless, the UV-C band region remains to be resolved. Here, we present our the development for the first time of UV-C light modulation in **Fig.(d)** by using hBN LCs, demonstrating a fairly fast in **Fig.(b)** switching tunability in **Fig.(a)** and stability in **Fig.(c)** in the reversible magnetic-modulation scheme. This work for manipulating solar-blind DUV region light opens up a promising opportunity potentially in photolithography, high-density data storage as well as some biomedical instruments.
