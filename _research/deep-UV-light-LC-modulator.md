## Preface

> Birefringence is a fundamental optical property that can allow some external stimulus, like magnetic or electrical field, to induce phase retardation of polarized light. Tuning the birefringence of liquid crystals (LCs) is a core technology for light manipulation in various applications, such as LC displays [^1], light modulators [^2], holographic imagers [^3], and optical tweezers [^4]. Most of these applications can only be used in the visible and infrared wavelengths, but rather than in as short as deep ultraviolet (DUV) wavelength. This is because the conventional LCs with organic components own the strong absorption or instability in the DUV spectral region. Therefore, the development of LCs without organic components is of great potential in manipulating DUV light.

> Here, we present the development of a transmissive DUV light modulator using two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-based inorganic LCs. We investigate its fundamental physical properties, such as birefringence and magnetism, giving rise to a giant magneto-optical effect due to its large shape anisotropy with a typical aspect ratio (defined as lateral size divided by thickness) 170. (for more info see main text) Fig.(a) shows a schematic of the optical path in the magnetic-field-induced optical experiment, and explanation of the light propagation by decomposing polarized light into horizontal and vertical components of electric-field vector. It is worth noticing that when magnetic field turns on, the alignment of hBN LCs is parallel to the magnetic field direction, which induces two electric-field vectors forming a phase retardation. These two components further propagate through the analyzer, thereby tuning the optical intensity. Fig.(b) shows strong magnetic-field-induced optical effects in the real cuvette (length 10 mm, width 10 mm and height 40 mm) filled with hBN LC suspensions, demonstrating light on and off when magnetic field turns on and off., where the two crossed polarizers marked by white double arrows are shown. Fig.(c) presents strong magnetic-field-induced optical effects of hBN LC suspension using our photomasks of “TBSI SGC” and panda patterns with a scale bar 5 mm.

> Magnetic-field-induced alignment of hBN LCs is also important in investigating the behavior of the optical switching, which is related to the determination of light propagation in the hBN LC suspension. Fig.(a) shows transmittance intensity varying of polarized laser light through hBN LCs when the polarization direction is parallel or perpendicular to a magnetic field of 0.8 Tesla. To our knowledge, light decomposed as horizontal and vertical components spatially propagates through hBN LC suspension. Here we show the illustration of polarization-direction-dependent optical loss, indicating the fact that light is absorbed or scattered heavily when the polarization direction is parallel to the horizontal rather than the vertical. This can speculate that the magnetic-field-induced hBN is parallel to the magnetic field direction.(for more details see main text). Fig.(b) demonstrates the measurement of a fundamental birefringence of hBN LCs, which is well fitted by an analytical model, where Δχ the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility plays a major role in controlling the alignment of hBN LCs. In order for magnetic-field-induced optical effects to intrinsic mechanism, we further investigate a specific Cotton-Mouton coefficient of the magneto-optical sensitivity of hBN LC in the suspension, which is experimentally measured with a giant number of 8.0 x 10^6 T^-2m^-1. This specific Cotton-Mouton coefficient has been analytically derived in this work with a derivative description xxxx, where it mainly depends on optical Δg and magnetic Δχ anisotropies of hBN LCs and is independent of the concentration of hBN LC suspension. (for more details see our paper)

> Based on the principal analysis of magnetic-field-induced optical effects of hBN LCs, we therefore investigate this hBN LCs to modulate DUV light as short as 266 nm. Nowadays, a lot of LC-related literatures have showed their good device performance working either in the visible or the infrared spectral region, even entering the UV-A spectral region, nevertheless, the UV-C band region remains to be resolved. Here, we present our the development for the first time of UV-C light modulation by using hBN LCs, demonstrating a fairly fast in Fig.(b) switching tunability in Fig.(a) and stability in Fig.(c) in the reversible magnetic-modulation scheme. This work for manipulating solar-blind DUV region light opens up a promising opportunity potentially in photolithography, high-density data storage as well as some biomedical instruments.
