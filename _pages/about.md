Welcome! Hao Xu works on optomechanics research at the Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Nanotechnology (IEMN), CNRS. Prior to joining in CNRS-IEMN in 2020, he completed his Master Degree in Electronics at Xi'an Jiaotong  University, China.

Research Keywords - Nanofabrication, MEMS and NEMS, Nanoelectronics, Optomechanics

My research centers on two main areas:

Nanofabrication for MEMS/NEMS. High-Q MEMS devices present their promising roles played by potential applications, such as force or mass sensors and quantum engineering. In the cleanroom, his fabrication method mainly focuses on using EB lithography and dry etching processes to fabricate high-Q devices, following with sample check and characterization (at room temperature).

Theory modeling and numerical simulating. With the help of cavity-enhanced sensing, the radiation pressure from light(microwave) circulating in one cavity enables optomechanical coupling between optical(microwave) mode and mechanical mode, thus allowing for sideband manipulating the displacement of the mechanical mode. His aim is to analyse a mode coupling nanoelectromechanical system while probe/pump multifrequency operating. This scheme offers a new opportunity for phonon based coupling optomechanics.

## News and activities

* **06/06/2023** I'am, with Xin, contributing to our research progress entitled "Scanning microwave microscopy for investigations of mechanical vibrations and mode coupling" in Frontiers of Nanomechanical Systems (FNS) workshop in Delft in the Netherlands.
* **12/05/2022** I'm online participating in a virtual LIMMS-IEMN workshop on NEMS/MEMS. I learn from the colleagues from LIMMS UTokyo and IEMN-CNRS and know recent advances in NEMS/MEMS, probing technologies (including AFM or KFM) and biomedical sensors.
* **10/25/2022** I'm attending a virtual meeting: Nature conference on Technologies for Neuroengineering 2022. I learn from the widespread colleagues in the field of Neuroengineering around the world.
* **10/06/2022** I'm attending 7th Annual Meeting: the GDR MecaQ Nanomechanics and Optomechanics seminar in Bordeaux, France. I spend a very nice time with the colleagues all over the Europe. Thank my advisor, Xin and Didier giving me this chance.
* **08/11/2022** Great news! My first-author Nature Nanotechnology article is published online. I am very appreciated my advisors, Bilu and Baofu for supporting me throughout all the work. Of course, without huge efforts from coauthors, this work is not possible, thanks all for supporting and discussing each step!
