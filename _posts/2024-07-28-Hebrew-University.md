This cousera takes a unique time for brain research discussion. The aperitif for the course will highlight the present “brain-excitements” worldwide. The learners will then become intimately acquainted with the operational principles of neuronal “life-ware” (synapses, neurons and the networks that they form) and consequently, on how neurons behave as computational microchips and how they plastically and constantly change  - a process that underlies learning and memory. Recent heroic attempts to realistically simulate large cortical networks in the computer will be highlighted (e.g., “the Blue Brain Project”) and processes related to perception, cognition and emotions in the brain will be discussed. For dessert we will deliberate on the future of brain research, including the questions of “brain and art”, consciousness and free will.

# Electrifying Brains (Passive Electrical Signals)

This module will show that neurons are electrical devices and what enables neurons to become “electrifying”.

* The Cell as a RC Circuit
* The Voltage Equation for the Passive Cell
* The Membrane Time Constant, Temporal Summation and the Resting Potential
* The Synaptic Potential (Part I: The Synaptic Conductance and The Synaptic Battery)
* The Synaptic Potential (Part II: The Voltage Equation for the Synapse and EPSP and IPSP)

# Electrifying Brains (Active Electrical Spikes)

This module will deal with the active electrical aspects of neurons. Synaptic inputs are the elementary (input) sources to neurons and, typically, many (excitatory) of them are required to summate (“temporal summation”) to generate a highly (“all or none”) output signal – the notorious spike (or “action potential”).

* The All or None Spike and the Voltage Clamp
* Membrane Currents Underlying the Spike
* Modeling the Membrane Currents
* Hodgkin & Huxley Spike Model

# Neurons as Plastic/Dynamic Devices

This module will discuss "Neurons as plastic/changing devices". Probably the most unique aspect of the nervous tissue is its amazing capability to constantly and adaptively change in response to a challenging environment; this capability enables us to learn and to store memories. 

* The Brain Learning
* Mechanisms Sub-serving Learning and Memory
* Functional Plasticity and Structural Plasticity
* Neurogenesis and Learning

# Cable Theory and Dendritic Computations

This module will show the cable properties of dendrites empower neurons with computational capabilities (e.g., neurons that compute the direction of motion). It will discuss a few early and more recent theoretical ideas on how the “neuronal hardware” – synapses, dendrites, axons and the signals that they carry - may implement elementary computations.

* The Brain Computes
* Computation at the Level of Single Neuron
* Fundamentals of Dendritic Cable Theory
* Rall Cable Theory for Dendrites
* Dendritic Computation

# Cortical Networks (Out of the Blue Project)

This module will show how single cells function, how they are connected via (plastic) synapses to each other and how they might perform specific computations.

* Mega Projects for the Brain
* The Blue Brain Project - The Start
* The Cortical Column
* A Cortical Column Networks
* Blue Brain Simulations
* From Mouse to Human
* The Human Brain Project
