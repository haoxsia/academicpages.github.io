This meeting will discuss exciting advances in the design, implementation, and clinical translation of technology for interfacing with the central and peripheral nervous systems in the context of human disease and health. The technologies will include bioelectronic interfaces, neuromodulation strategies, neuroprosthetics, and brainâ€“machine interfaces.
