# MecaQ webinar series

The MecaQ webinar series is a collection of monthly webinars delivered by high-profile international scientists in the fields of optomechanics and nanomechanics.

* Title: Measuring the higher-order phonon statistics in a nanogram volume of superfluid helium
* Speaker: Jack Harris, Yale University & Yale Quantum Institute
* Abstract: We detect the individual sideband photons produced by an optomechanical device consisting of a nanogram of superfluid helium confined in a cavity. We use the photon-counting data to probe the phonon-phonon correlations (up to fourth order, and for both normal-ordering and anti-normal-ordering) in a single acoustic mode of the superfluid. The data is consistent the assumption that the acoustic mode is in a thermal state with mean phonon number ~ 1. We also use sideband-photon counting to show that the acoustic mode can be driven to a coherent amplitude corresponding to several thousand phonons with no decrease in the purity of the acoustic state. We will discuss a number of applications of these results, including to the distribution of entanglement over kilometer-scale optical fiber networks.
