This course introduces a few engineering concepts related to structures. Its interests focus mainly on bridges and buildings but 'structures' also include trees, furniture, and most solid objects. Giving learners a different perspective on the structures.

a [fantastic handout](https://students.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Resumes-and-CVs-2021-Final-1.pdf) on differences between the two documents and how to adapt a CV into a résumé that I drew on heavily in this process.
