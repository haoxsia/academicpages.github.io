Microfabrication and nanofabrication are the basis of manufacturing for nearly all modern miniaturized systems that are ubiquitously used in our daily life. Examples include computer chips and integrated sensors for monitoring our environment, cars, mobile phones, medical devices and more.

# MEMS introduction and cleanroom rules

This module introduces the basics of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and cleanroom fabrication.

* Successful MEMS
* Bimorph case study
* Cleanroom basics and CMi overview

# Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)

This module on chemical vapor deposition or CVD describes in detail basic principles of CVD and shows the cleanroom infrastructure that is used to run a CVD process. 

* Overview of CVD techniques
* Theoretical aspects of CVD
* Specific CVD processes

# Lithography principles and applications

This module on lithography describes in details the two main resist patterning methods: optical and electron beam lithography. Physical principles, setup configurations, process parameters, resist properties, advantages and limitations, as well as examples are introduced and discussed for these two techniques. In addition, an overview of some alternative techniques such as thermal scanning probe lithography is also presented.

* General concepts of lithography
* Optical UV lithography
* Electron beam lithography
* Alternative patterning methods

# Dry etching

This module on dry etching describes etching in a gas environment. 

* Overview of dry etching techniques
* Theoretical concepts of dry etching
* Dry etching experimental systems
* Specific dry etching processes

# Wet etching

This module on wet etching describes etching in a liquid environment. 

* Wet etching of oxides
* Isotropic and anisotropic wet etching of silicon
* Bulk and surface micromachining of silicon

# Inspection and Metrology

This module describes methods of inspection and metrology based on four technique categories: optical, mechanical, charged beam and electrical.

* Optical techniques
* Mechanical techniques
* Charged beam techniques
* Electrical techniques
