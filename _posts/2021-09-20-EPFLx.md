Microfabrication and nanofabrication are the basis of manufacturing for nearly all modern miniaturized systems that are ubiquitously used in our daily life. Examples include computer chips and integrated sensors for monitoring our environment, cars, mobile phones, medical devices and more.

# Introduction: MEMS devices and cleanroom rules
The [valid certificate](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/5266f05454de438182c8374b82e669e6) has a [fantastic handout](https://students.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Resumes-and-CVs-2021-Final-1.pdf) on differences between the two documents and how to adapt a CV into a résumé that I drew on heavily in this process.

# Lithography: Principles and applications


# Dry/wet etching
