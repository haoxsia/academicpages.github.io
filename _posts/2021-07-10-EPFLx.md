Overview of a generic optomechanical system including the optical domain and the microwave domain is shown above [^1]. Optomechanics is the study of the interaction between light and mechanical systems which can result in the manipulation of the state of both light and the mechanics. The nature of this interaction makes it interesting for a wide range of applications in both fundamental physics and technological advancements.
