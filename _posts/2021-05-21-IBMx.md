"A picture is worth a thousand words". This course provides all familiarities with this expression.

For long time, one may use Microsoft Excel or more professional Origin to plot the data to convey the meaning. Not enough now, the data visualization with Python is introduced right now! That is a useful and powerful programming language to interact the data expression with human.
