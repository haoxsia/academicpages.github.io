"A picture is worth a thousand words". This course provides all familiarities with this expression. It especially applies when trying to explain the insight obtained from the analysis of increasingly large datasets. Data visualization plays an essential role in the representation of both small and large-scale data.

# Introduction to Visualization Tools

If you are an academic, it is great essential in the data visualization to show your readers more clear in your expression. That's why I learn and post this! For long time, one may use Microsoft Excel or more professional Origin to plot the data to convey the meaning. Not enough, the data visualization with Python is introduced right now! That is a useful and powerful programming language to interact the data expression with human.
